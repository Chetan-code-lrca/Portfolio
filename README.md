## 🚀 The Mission
I built this portfolio not just to list my skills, but to create an **immersive experience**. As an AI/ML Engineer, I believe that the presentation of data and models is just as important as the logic behind them. This site uses vanilla technologies to achieve a "Neural Network" aesthetic—symbolizing the complex, interconnected systems I build every day.
